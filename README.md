Bloodsap Forest is a first-person survival horror game where you’re trapped in a foggy, dark forest, hunted by a relentless creature. With no weapons and only a flashlight, your goal is to collect scattered pages that reveal the path to escape. Every page anticipates danger, forcing you to rely on stealth, sound awareness, and sheer nerve. 
It’s a minimalist, atmospheric experience inspired by PS2-era horror, perfect for players who crave suspense, nostalgic aesthetics, and a horror challenge.
